- *Text Highlighting*: Uses regular expressions to highlight matching search terms
- *Dynamic Content*: Updates the DOM to show filtered results
- *Case-Insensitive Search*: Searches through both article titles and content

# Sample Data

The application includes sample articles about:
- Coding concepts and tutorials
- Programming best practices
- Development tools and workflows
- Technical guides and explanations

# Browser Compatibility

This application works on all modern browsers including:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

# Future Improvements

Potential enhancements could include:
- Adding more article categories
- Implementing search filters
- Adding a clear search button
- Improving mobile responsiveness

# About
